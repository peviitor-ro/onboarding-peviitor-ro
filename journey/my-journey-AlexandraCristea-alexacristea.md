# Hello everyone! 🦊

My name is Alexandra and I want to learn as much as possible about manual testing (after some time, I would like to go further to automation), so I can contribute to this project, and be a valuable colleague. I would also like to see how the teams collaborate in IT projects, especially the QA team.

## What I'm looking for

I'm eager to connect with experienced IT people, to learn, grow, and gain hands-on experience in qa testing. I want to learn more and familiarize with tools like Jira, Git, GitHub, along with other tools commonly utilized in work environments. 
And of course, with the experience gained from here, I wish to find a job as a Junior QA Tester. :D

Hey, my name is Florin, a passionate junior developer. I started in this branch out of curiosity and, eventually, I attended the University of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science / Computers” and also obtained my master's degree in the same domain.
I have more than 8 years old experience in IT and Advertising freelancing on various platforms on easy and complex tasks with scratch development or all kind of integrations.
Fast learner, hard worker and team player, known for the ability to multi-task and juggle multiple projects simultaneously, meeting all deadlines.
I like to see things from a positive perspective and learn something new each day. In this journey, I'm also interested in improving my soft skills.

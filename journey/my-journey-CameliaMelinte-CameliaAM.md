### Hi!
My name is Camelia and I'm a Junior Tester actively seeking opportunities to gain experience and further develop my skills in the field of software testing.
I have solid foundation in tools such as JIRA and Postman, as well as basic understanding of My SQL. I have also learned Python for automated testing, which I utilized to implement the Selenium library and the BDD framework in my recent project.  
My ultimate goal is to become a highly skilled software tester with extensive experience in both manual and automated testing to ensure high quality standards.

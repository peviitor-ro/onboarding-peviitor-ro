Hello there!

My name is Andreea and I am on a continuous journey of self-improvement, being always open to learning new things, making each experience a step forward in my journey.
Having completed a manual and automation testing course, I want to apply the theoretical foundations I have built and further enhance my skills through practical experience. 
I understand the importance of being part of a supportive team and I believe that collaboration will speed up my learning and let me contribute in a meaningful way. 
So my objectives are not only comprehending the intricacies of the project, but also connecting with the project team and to expand my knowledge and skills, focusing particularly on testing methodologies as a Manual Tester/ Automation Tester.
To enhance my toolset, I aim to familiarize myself with Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ and others.
Keeping my LinkedIn profile updated is important to showcase my evolving skills and progress and also to create a portfolio to spotlight my achievements and actively engage in networking opportunities.

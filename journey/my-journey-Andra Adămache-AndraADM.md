Hello everyone!
My name is Andra and I recently discovered my passion for testing, and after the GOIT course,
it was confirmed that I really love testing. As I am just starting out, I want to gain experience in manual testing.
I tend to look for perfection in almost everything, that's why I chose this path, as a software tester.
I am also a punctual and responsible person for her tasks.
